## Host all music in one place

The purpose of this project is to keep track of all your music in one place and no longer worry about having music exclusive to one service.

## Reason for this project

1. I got tired of random videos getting deleted in my Youtube playlist and having no idea which ones. Note: playlist is around 700 songs

2. Some stuff that I listen to is only on Spotify and Soundcloud.

## Languages

At the moment it will just be these:

- Angular
- HTML
- CSS
- Typescript
- svg

NB: Trying to use svg's to save on api calls for images.
